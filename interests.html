        So you want to know what I like!
        
        Here goes:
        
        <ul>
          <b>Games</b>: I like board games and handheld games. I go to board game cafes like <a href="http://www.snakesandlattes.com"; 
          style="text-decoration: none"/>Snakes & Lattes</a> and <a href="http://castleboardgames.com/"; style="text-decoration: none"
          >Castle</a> in Toronto with friends. Favourites include the Cards Against Humanity series, The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, 
          and Betrayal at House on the Hill. As for handheld games I like Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, and Dangan Ronpa.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Comics</b>: My girlfriend and I have a bookshelf dedicated to North American and Japanese comics. In fact, we met because we   
          both liked a webcomic, in fact. I go to the Toronto Comic Arts Festival every year and many of my friends are published or 
          aspiring comic artists. I love reading (or watching) stories that start from drawings and doodles.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Cosplay</b>: I'm sure you've realized I'm a big ol' nerd by this point. Cosplay is a Japanese portmanteau of the English
          words "costume" and "play". It means dressing up as a fictional character at events and doing photoshoots, videos, skits, and
          sometimes contests. I like cosplaying from North American and Japanese comics, bands, video games, TV shows, and movies. I've   
          been cosplaying for the past decade and love going to comic conventions in Ontario and elsewhere.
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Pride</b>: I am in an openly lesbian relationship with a trans woman. Bringing awareness to queer issues and positive 
        representation is a big part of who I am.. I want to raise awareness about the most vulnerable and ignored people in the LGBT 
        community, issues such as transphobia in the media and homeless queer youth. This past year I marched in the Dyke March and the 
        Trans march and I love talking with people who are feminist, sex-positive, and all-inclusive when it comes to queer issues.
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Indulgences</b>: I have a terrible obsession with Lush Cosmetics and buy everything there from dish soap to toothpaste.
        It's like a coffee addiction, but it's soap. At least I'm clean.
          
        </ul>
